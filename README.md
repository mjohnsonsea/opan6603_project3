### Project 3: Travelbiz (PCA and Clustering)

#### Project Summary
Investigating the behavioral patterns and preferences of users through data available on e-commerce and tourism-related platforms could provide valuable information for businesses in establishing marketing strategies and offering added value to their customers. For example, how travelers rate the destination amenities inï¬‚uences their travel plans including location, type of activities and number of days that travel marketers may be able to use to adapt digital marketing strategies according to the origin of customers. 

This dataset is populated by capturing user ratings (n=5456) from Google reviews in 2018. Your client is an American-based online travel and tourism organization (Travelbiz) and their marketing and product management team is interested in creating travel packages to Europe and promoting them to potential customers. The client has acquired this data and is interested in understanding if there are specific segments of customers that they should be targeting and what type of travel packages to develop for these specific segments. The marketing team would also like to know how to position their packages and how to target customers using the available data. For example, what should a package look like for each segment, and where should these be advertised?
